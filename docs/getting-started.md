# Getting Started

!!! warning
    This documentation site is a work in progress, and is being tested and refined internally. Do not use this documentation as a reference in its current state.

Once JupyterHub has been added to your Canvas site, students and teaching staff in the course will see a "JupyterHub" link in the left hand navigation of their Canvas page.

Clicking that link will give access to the JupyterHub dashboard, where a blue "Start My Server" button can be found. Clicking that link will start the process of allocating resources where the JupyterLab instance will run. This process will take a few minutes, but once the server is created, it can be used for as long as you like.
