# JupyterLab General documentation

Our JupyterHub service uses the JupyterLab interface. The main [JupyterLab documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an excellent resource on the interface, and teaching staff may want to direct students to particular portions of the documentation for an overview of how to perform tasks related to their coursework.
