# HUIT Academic Technology JupyterHub

HUIT Academic Technology provides a JupyterHub platform for use in FAS courses. This tool is set up to integrate into an existing Canvas course. If needed, a customized Python environment can be configured with specific packages that are necessary for work in a course.

To request JupyterHub or another academic computing platform for your FAS course, please visit [atg.fas.harvard.edu/academic-computing](https://atg.fas.harvard.edu/academic-computing)

This site provides an overview of how our implementation of JupyterHub works, as well as pointers to how Jupyter environments work more generally.
