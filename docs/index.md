HUIT Academic Technology provides a JupyterHub platform for use in FAS courses. We can provide an interactive Jupyter Lab environment accessible through Canvas to courses in the FAS, and can customize environments with specific packages required by courses.

To request JupyterHub or another academic computing platform for your FAS course, please visit [atg.fas.harvard.edu/academic-computing](https://atg.fas.harvard.edu/academic-computing)

This site provides an overview of how the platform works in our implementation, as well as pointers to how Jupyter environments work more generally.
