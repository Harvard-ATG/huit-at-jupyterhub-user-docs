# Troubleshooting

## What should I do if my notebook is hanging/non-responsive?
* First try to restart your Jupyter Kernel. From your notebook, go to Kernel > Shutdown and confirm by clicking the Shutdown button. Then click on Kernel > Restart Kernel...
* If restarting your kernel did not resolve the problem, try restarting your Jupyter server. Go to your JupyterHub home page via File > Hub Control Panel. From there, you can click on the "Stop My Server" button. Wait a minute or two for your server to completely stop and then click Start My Server.
* If restarting your kernel or server did not resolve the problem, contact your instructor or other course staff. If you are course staff, or cannont resolve the issue with their help, reach out to atg@fas.harvard.edu for assistance.
